## What is BrightDeveloper?

**BrightDeveloper** is BrightSign's developer program-clear documentation, working code, and starter projects ready to customize. Whether you're building a CMS, a kiosk application, or an AI-powered analytics solution, we want you to go from idea to production as fast as possible.

Our goal: **your first successful API call in under 15 minutes**, and a clear path from "Hello World" to a fully working application.

This program is for software developers building on BrightSign. If you just need to create presentations and manage players without writing code, check out [BrightAuthor:connected](https://www.brightsign.biz/brightauthor-connected/) and [BSN.cloud](https://www.brightsign.biz/bsn-cloud/).

## Vision & Mission

### Mission
Inspire and empower software developers to build innovative solutions on the BrightSign platform (and enabling AI assistance)

### Vision
Make BrightSign the platform developers choose first. Clear docs, working code, and a complete SDK that AI assistants can use to generate correct, working integrations. Ship in hours, not weeks.

### AI-First Approach
Developers increasingly use LLMs to accelerate their work. **This is the future, and we're building for it.** Every piece of documentation, every code example, and especially our SDK is designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants. When a developer pastes our docs into Claude, Copilot, or Cursor, the generated code should work on the first try.

## How We Think About Developer Experience

We've designed everything here for both **humans and AI assistants**. Every guide explains the *why*, not just the *what*. Every code example runs without modification. Paste any of our documentation into Claude, Copilot, or Cursor and get working code.

**Our priorities:**

1. **Cloud-first** - BSN.cloud APIs for managing players, content, and schedules at scale
2. **On-player development** - Chromium (HTML/JavaScript) and Node.js for local applications
3. **Edge AI** - NPU development on XS6 for computer vision and analytics
4. **Extensions** - For capabilities that require going deeper
